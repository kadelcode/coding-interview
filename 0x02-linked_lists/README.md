# Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node.
-  Each node contains two parts:
    -  data
    -  a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. 

## Components of a Linked List
- Node: An individual element of a linked list, containing:

    - **Data**: The value stored in the node.
    - **Next**: A reference to the next node in the list.

- Head: A reference to the first node in the linked list. If the list is empty, the head is None.

## Types of Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next node and the previous node.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node.
